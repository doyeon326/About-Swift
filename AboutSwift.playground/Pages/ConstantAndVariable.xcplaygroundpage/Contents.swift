/*
 
 Constant and Variable = where to store the data.
 
 Constant[let] - is a data store that you set once and can never change.
 Variable[var] - is a data store that can have its value changed whenever you want.

 */

//Constant
let a: Int = 30
//a = 300 NO!

//Variable
var b: Int = 200
b = 100 //OK

/*
 So when to use Variable and Constant?
 
 Ex. In Iphone setting, there's memory usage to check the total memory from the phone and the memory used.
 -> Total memory cannot be changed because you cannot expand the memory provided by apple.
 -> however, the memory used can be change depends on the user's usage. When you download the app or take a photo, or even deleting some of the app could make the amount of memory change.
